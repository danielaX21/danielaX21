**About Me**

Hey there! I'm Daniela, a Computer Engineering student with an insatiable passion for technology, problem-solving, and innovation. The more complex the challenge, the more excited I am to tackle it.

# ðŸ’¡ What Drives Me?
**Curiosity & Challenge** â€“ I thrive on challenges that push my limits. If itâ€™s easy, I get bored. If itâ€™s broken, I fix it. If it works, I optimize it.
**Building & Breaking** â€“ I love creating things, but I also love breaking them apart to understand how they work.
**Learning & Evolving** â€“ Tech never sleeps, and neither does my drive to stay ahead.

# ðŸ”§ What I Work With

Languages: C, Java, C#, Python, Go, C++ (Either I know them or I'm in the process of learning)

Current Focus: Making authentication & authorization in REST APIs actually secure with OAuth & JWT
Also, C# learning :)

# ðŸŽ¯ Interests
From hardware to cloud, AI to algorithmsâ€”if it's tech, I'm there! Whether I'm assembling circuits from scratch, training machines to think, or launching systems into the cloud, Iâ€™m all about soaking up knowledge from every corner of tech.
Iâ€™m eager to learn anything and everything, constantly exploring new concepts and skills to level up my tech game!


ðŸ¤¯ Fun Fact

I have a 6th sense for spotting bugs, especially in other people's code - I'm like Sherlock Holmes. And when it comes to debugging my own, well,  it's more  like I'm in a Scooby-Doo mystery.

# Why am I here?

Iâ€™m here to build, collaborate, and innovate. If you're working on something mind-bendingly cool, letâ€™s talkâ€”I promise I won't refactor your code (immediately). ðŸš€
