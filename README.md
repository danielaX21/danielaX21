##  About Me

Hi, Iâ€™m **Daniela** , a final-year Computer Engineering student whoâ€™s always curious, always learning, and always striving to grow.

I may not know everything (yet), but give me a challenge and Iâ€™ll dive in headfirst. Whether itâ€™s a new technology, an unfamiliar tool, or a broken system I believe anything can be figured out with enough persistence and willingness to learn.

##  What I Stand For

I'm not here to be just another engineer.

I want to be the kind of engineer people remember.The one you can count on when things get tough. The one who doesnâ€™t back down from hard problems, who learns fast and adapts even faster. The one who brings value not just through skills, but through drive, work ethic, and mindset.

I donâ€™t want to be replaceable. I want to be exceptional.

##  What I'm Working With

**Languages:**  
C, C++, C#, Java, Python, Go (some I know well, others Iâ€™m still mastering)

**Current focus:**   
- Quantum Computing

## Interests

From writing code to soldering hardware, I love the feeling of making something real, especially when it solves a real problem.  
Whether it's cloud systems, embedded devices, or automation tools, I'm here for all of it. Iâ€™m eager to learn anything and everything, constantly exploring new concepts and skills to level up my tech game!

I think every project is a chance to learn and every bug is an opportunity to improve.

##  Why I'm Here

To build, to learn, and to become **"that" engineer**â€”  
Not average. Not replaceable.  
Memorable.

Letâ€™s make something great.
