##  About Me

Hi, Iâ€™m **Daniela** , a final-year Computer Engineering student whoâ€™s always curious, always learning, and always striving to grow.

I may not know everything (yet), but give me a challenge and Iâ€™ll dive in headfirst. Whether itâ€™s a new technology, an unfamiliar tool, or a broken system I believe anything can be figured out with enough persistence and willingness to learn.

##  Why I'm Here

To build, to learn, and to become **"that" engineer**â€”  
Not average. Not replaceable.  
Memorable.

Letâ€™s make something great.
